 *
 * Part 2: Expression Templates
 * Write C++ templates which allow you to use types to represent arithmetic
 * expressions over the four basic operations (addition, subtraction,
 * multiplication and division), a single variable, and integer exponentiation:
 * (e.g. x^2+(x-2)^3/5). For the purposes of this assignment we refer to the
 * single variable as x.
 *
 * The types representing the expressions should contain a function named "eval"
 * that provides code for evaluating the expression. This function should accept
 * a double parameter that will be used as the value for the single variable x.
